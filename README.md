# Boundary Enterprise Controller HVD on AWS EC2

Terraform module aligned with HashiCorp Validated Designs (HVD) to deploy Boundary Enterprise Controller(s) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using EC2 instances. This module is designed to work with the complimentary [Boundary Enterprise Worker HVD on AWS EC2](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-boundary-enterprise-worker-hvd) module.

## Boundary Architecture

This diagram shows a Boundary deployment with one controller and two sets of Boundary Workers, one for ingress and another for egress. Please review [Boundary deployment customizations doc](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-boundary-enterprise-controller-hvd/blob/main/docs/deployment-customizations.md) to understand different deployment settings for the Boundary deployment.

## Prerequisites

### General

- Terraform CLI `>= 1.9` installed on workstations.
- `Git` CLI and Visual Studio Code editor installed on workstations are strongly recommended.
- AWS account that Boundary will be hosted in with permissions to provision these [resources](#resources) via Terraform CLI.
- (Optional) AWS S3 bucket for [S3 Remote State backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3) that will solely be used to stand up the Boundary infrastructure via Terraform CLI (Community Edition).

### Networking

- AWS VPC ID and the following subnets:
  - Load balancer subnet IDs (can be the same as EC2 subnets if desirable).
  - EC2 (controller) subnet IDs.
  - RDS (database) subnet IDs.
- (Optional) KMS VPC Endpoint configured within VPC.
- (Optional) AWS Route53 Hosted Zone for Boundary DNS record creation.
- Security Groups:
  - This module will create the necessary Security Groups and attach them to the applicable resources.
  - Ensure the [Boundary Network connectivity](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/docs/install-boundary/architecture/system-requirements#network-connectivity) are met.

### Secrets Manager

- **Boundary license file** - raw contents of Boundary license file (`*.hclic`) (ex: `cat boundary.hclic`)
- **RDS (PostgreSQL) database password** - used to create AWS Aurora Database; randomly generate this yourself, fetched from within the module via data source.
- **Boundary TLS certificate** - file in PEM format, base64-encoded into a string, and stored as a plaintext secret.
- **Boundary TLS certificate private key** - file in PEM format, base64-encoded into a string, and stored as a plaintext secret.
- **TLS CA bundle** - file in PEM format, base64-encoded into a string, and stored as a plaintext secret.

>📝 Note: see the [Boundary cert rotation docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-boundary-enterprise-controller-hvd/blob/main/docs/boundary-cert-rotation.md) for instructions on how to base64-encode the certificates with proper formatting.

### Compute

One of the following mechanisms for shell access to Boundary EC2 instances:

- EC2 SSH Key Pair.
- Ability to enable AWS SSM (this module supports this via a boolean input variable).

### KMS

This module supports creating the necessary KMS keys, Root, Recovery, Worker and BSR with the variables: `create_root_kms_key`, `create_recovery_kms_key`, `create_worker_kms_key` and if session recording is to be enabled, `create_bsr_kms_key`. If due to security policy KMS keys have to be provisioned outside this module, these variables can be set to `false` and the arn of each of the existing KMS keys can be provided with these variables, `root_kms_key_arn`, `recovery_kms_key_arn`, `worker_kms_key_arn` and if session recording is to be enabled `bsr_kms_key_arn`. Ensure that these already created KMS keys have a KMS policy that enables IAM authorization as this module will create IAM polices that grant access to these KMS keys.

## Usage

1. Create/configure/validate the applicable [prerequisites](#prerequisites).

1. Nested within the [examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-boundary-enterprise-controller-hvd/blob/main/examples/) directory are subdirectories that contain ready-made Terraform configurations of example scenarios for how to call and deploy this module. To get started, choose an example scenario. If you are not sure which example scenario to start with, then we recommend starting with the [default](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-aws-boundary-enterprise-controller-hvd/blob/main/examples/default) example.

1. Copy all of the Terraform files from your example scenario of choice into a new destination directory to create your root Terraform configuration that will manage your Boundary deployment. If you are not sure where to create this new directory, it is common for us to see users create an `environments/` directory at the root of this repo, and then a subdirectory for each Boundary instance deployment, like so:

    ```sh
    .
    └── environments
        ├── production
        │   ├── backend.tf
        │   ├── main.tf
        │   ├── outputs.tf
        │   ├── terraform.tfvars
        │   └── variables.tf
        └── sandbox
            ├── backend.tf
            ├── main.tf
            ├── outputs.tf
            ├── terraform.tfvars
            └── variables.tf
    ```

    >📝 Note: in this example, the user will have two separate Boundary deployments; one for their `sandbox` environment, and one for their `production` environment. This is recommended, but not required.

1. (Optional) Uncomment and update the [S3 remote state backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3) configuration provided in the `backend.tf` file with your own custom values. While this step is highly recommended, it is technically not required to use a remote backend config for your Boundary deployment.

1. Populate your own custom values into the `terraform.tfvars.example` file that was provided, and remove the `.example` file extension such that the file is now named `terraform.tfvars`.

1. Navigate to the directory of your newly created Terraform configuration for your Boundary Controller deployment, and run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply`.

1. After your `terraform apply` finishes successfully, you can monitor the installation progress by connecting to your Boundary EC2 instance shell via SSH or AWS SSM and observing the cloud-init (user_data) logs:

    Higher-level logs:

    ```sh
    tail -f /var/log/boundary-cloud-init.log
    ```

    Lower-level logs:

    ```sh
    journalctl -xu cloud-final -f
    ```

    >📝 Note: the `-f` argument is to follow the logs as they append in real-time, and is optional. You may remove the `-f` for a static view.

    The log files should display the following message after the cloud-init (user_data) script finishes successfully:

    ```sh
    [INFO] boundary_custom_data script finished successfully!
    ```

1. Once the cloud-init script finishes successfully, while still connected to the VM via SSH you can check the status of the boundary service:

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl status boundary
    ```

1. After the Boundary Controller is deployed the Boundary system will be partially initialized. To complete the initialization process and setup an initial auth method, username and password, please use the [terraform-boundary-bootstrap-hvd](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/bootstrap-hvd/boundary/latest) module

1. Use the [terraform-aws-boundary-worker-hvd](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/boundary-enterprise-worker-hvd/aws/latest) module to deploy ingress, egress, etc workers as needed.
